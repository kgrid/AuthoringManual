# Authoring Knowledge Objects

In this section, we have included some helpful information in authoring knowledge objects \(KO\). Getting started provides a brief crash course through a simple example to familiarize authors with the process of creating KO. We have also included an authoring checklist to keep track of your progress along the way, The next sections, creating algorithms, test functions, input/output ref and README files, will go into more detail, guided by examples and usable templates.
