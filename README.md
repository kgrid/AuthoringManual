# Introduction

Welcome to the Knowledge Grid \(KGrid\) Authoring and Managing Manual. This manual will address both the Authoring and Managing aspects of knowledge objects. The main purpose of a knowledge object is to contain an executable script for others to utilize on collected health data. This requires a consensus of guidelines in order to utilize the knowledge grid to its fullest potential.

Overall, prior to creating a knowledge object within the ObjectTeller library, an executable script \(payload\) and input/output rdfs must be created. Once the knowledge object content is ready, we then turn to the process of managing. Managing knowledge objects include both the process of creating a new knowledge object on the ObjectTeller library, and editing existing knowledge objects.

In the [Getting Started](https://kgrid.gitbooks.io/authoring-ii/content/getting-started.html) section, we will walk through a basic example of creating a knowledge object.

For information on how to execute knowledge objects on the execution stack, see the [Execution Manual](https://www.gitbook.com/book/kgrid/execution-manual/details).
