# Introduction

As part of the larger Knowledge Grid program for knowledge organization, management, and dissemination, an application, "ObjectTeller", is a novel digital library system, part of a larger knowledge-delivery mechanism, that aims towards supporting knowledge delivery throughout a Learning Health System.

As a software application, ObjectTeller embodies a digital library for computable health knowledge, and presages a time when large, open libraries of computable health knowledge are made available to a wide variety of users. Each externalized and modularized algorithm or computable "model" of some sort is held within an individual knowledge object. Opportunities to utilize multiple interacting knowledge objects are enabled by this technology. Knowledge objects are referred to here sometimes simple as "KOs." Creating a KO using ObjectTeller has the potential to promote interdisciplinary collaboration, by allowing people to share in the processes of design, development, implementation and use of KOs.

This Knowledge Objects Authoring & Managing Manual provides users with a set of basic instructions and guidelines, for creating KOs. Overall, prior to creating a knowledge object within the ObjectTeller library, an executable script \(payload\) must be created. Once the knowledge object content is ready, we then turn to the process of managing. Managing knowledge objects include both the process of creating a new knowledge object on the ObjectTeller library, and editing existing knowledge objects.

In the [Getting Started](http://kgrid.org/AuthoringManual/getting-started) section, we will walk through a basic example of creating a knowledge object. All pages can be found [here](http://kgrid.org/AuthoringManual/summary).

For information on how to execute knowledge objects on the activator, see the [Authoring Manual](http://kgrid.org/AuthoringManual/).
