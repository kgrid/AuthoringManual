# Authoring Knowledge Objects

As part of the larger Knowledge Grid program for knowledge organization, management, and dissemination, an application, "ObjectTeller", is a novel digital library system, part of a larger knowledge-delivery mechanism, that aims towards supporting knowledge delivery throughout a Learning Health System. 

As a software application, ObjectTeller embodies a digital library for computable health knowledge, and presages a time when large, open libraries of computable health knowledge are made available to a wide variety of users. Each externalized and modularized algorithm or computable "model" of some sort is held within an individual knowledge object. Opportunities to utilize multiple interacting knowledge objects are enabled by this technology. Knowledge objects are referred to here sometimes simple as "KOs." Creating a KO using ObjectTeller has the potential to promote interdisciplinary collaboration, by allowing people to share in the processes of design, development, implementation and use of KOs. 	

This Knowledge Objects Authoring Manual provides users with a set of basic instructions, and with some guidelines, for creating KOs. All KO discussed have been written in python 2. Additional questions beyond the information given can be directed to:  dlhs.knowledge.grid@umich.edu.
