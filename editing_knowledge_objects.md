## Editing Knowledge Objects

After you have created a knowledge object, you can edit it through the ObjectTeller library. However, changes to code can be done within Object Teller, but the object will need to be re-added to the execution stack shelf after each change.

To edit KO:

1. Login to your account and open the KO of interest.
2. Click the "Edit" button.
3. When done editing the KO, click the green X labeled "Close".
